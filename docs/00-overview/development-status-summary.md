## 1. Executive summary

The repository is a **working Turborepo + pnpm monorepo** with foundational packages (`types`, `config`, `core`, `database`), a **Next.js 15 web app** (Mantine, next-intl, `/en` and `/ar`), **sample company JSON**, **GitHub Actions CI**, and expanded **Drizzle schema / migrations** (including RLS-oriented work — verify against phase acceptance checklists).

**Phase 01 (platform integration)** is largely implemented in code: `@agenticverdict/data-connectors` ships Meta, GA4, GSC, GBP, and TikTok adapters with shared normalization, caching (memory + optional Upstash), rate limiting, circuit breaking, health helpers, and **Next.js `/api/health*` routes**. Operational documentation lives under [`01-connectors/operations/`](../../specs/00-core/01-connectors/operations/README.md), including **[SECURITY.md](../../specs/00-core/01-connectors/operations/SECURITY.md)**. Cross-package integration tests run from `tests/phase01-platform-integration/`.

**Requirements alignment (2026-04-04):** [`requirements.md`](../05-project-management/requirements.md) now explicitly requires a **non-empty `tenantId`** for every `BaseConnectorAdapter` construction (`missing_tenant_id` error if violated) and states **security expectations** for DB access and secrets handling, with pointers to Phase 01 operations docs.

Remaining work spans **full phase exit criteria** (coverage targets, `apps/api` / `apps/worker`, Playwright, production verification — see §3 and the [implementation review](./reviews/phase-01-implementation-review-2026-04-04.md)).

### 2.4 Integration test workspace

| Package / path                       | Status | Notes                                                                                               |

### 2.5 Other packages (from target architecture)

### 2.6 Data and samples

| Item                                                          | Status                        |

## 3. Gaps

Severity is **blocking** for formal phase exit vs **important** vs **later**. Line items below must be reconciled against the authoritative `acceptance-criteria.md` files under [`specs/00-core/`](../../specs/00-core/README.md) (this summary is not a sign-off).

### 3.1 Relative to Phase 0 acceptance criteria (`acceptance-criteria.md`)

| Topic             | Gap                                                                                                                                               | Severity   |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| Monorepo          | `apps/api`, `apps/worker` and some planned `packages/*` still absent                                                                              | Important  |
| Configuration     | No single `ConfigManager` class / env-merge layer as named in older task lists; file-based load is primary                                        | Important  |
| Database          | Compare live Drizzle schema + migrations to the full table list in acceptance criteria; close any remaining tables/policies                       | Important  |
| RLS               | Policies and `dbScoped` exist; **prove** end-to-end tenant isolation for every tenant-owned table per acceptance criteria                         | Important  |
| Multi-tenancy     | Production-style resolution (JWT, host, headers) and `runWithTenantContext` on all server paths that touch `dbScoped` still need product wiring   | Blocking\* |
| UI foundation     | No Storybook; no shared `packages/ui` workspace package (stub removed 2026-04-11)                                                                 | Important  |
| i18n              | Required locales **`ar`/`en`** are in routing; translation depth beyond minimal coverage remains a quality follow-up ( **`fr` is not required** ) | Important  |
| Testing           | Global coverage targets (e.g. 85%+ business logic) and Playwright E2E not yet met per methodology docs                                            | Important  |
| CI/CD             | CI present (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`); extend with Postgres services / coverage gates as needed                                                 | Later      |
| Performance / NFR | Production SLAs and endurance still unverified (see Phase 01 review and `PERFORMANCE-BENCHMARKS.md`)                                              | Important  |

\*Blocking for **end-to-end multi-tenant product behavior**, not for continued Phase 02 scaffolding.

### 3.2 Relative to `tasks.md` (102 tasks)

- **Sections 1–6, 9–10**: many granular tasks still open (Husky, Docker Compose, etc.) — treat `implementation-scope.md` as the deferral guide.
- **Section 7 (platform adapters)**: **largely implemented** in `@agenticverdict/data-connectors` (see `changelog/2026-04-04-phase-01-*.md`).
- **Section 8 (agent runtime)**: still **deferred** until Phase 02 focus.
- **Task 0.20** (second sample company): optional gap.
- **Upstash Redis**: optional path for distributed cache in adapters when env vars are set; not required for all dev flows.

### 3.3 Relative to suggested waves (`implementation-scope.md`)

| Wave | Intended outcome   | Gap / update (2026-04-04)                                                                                 |
| ---- | ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| W0   | Monorepo + tooling | Husky, lint-staged, commitlint still optional                                                             |
| W1   | Config + types     | Env-merge / hot-reload / doc generator gaps remain                                                        |
| W2   | DB + tenancy       | Migrations and RLS work advanced; finish verification vs acceptance criteria                              |
| W3   | Web + i18n         | **Health routes added**; required **`ar`/`en`** locale shell met (**`fr` not in scope** as a requirement) |
| W4   | Testing + CI       | **CI added**; coverage enforcement and Playwright still open                                              |

### 3.4 Phase 01 follow-ups (from implementation review)

See [`reviews/phase-01-implementation-review-2026-04-04.md`](./reviews/phase-01-implementation-review-2026-04-04.md): remaining items include **coverage ramp**, **production performance validation**, and **security verification** beyond documentation.

### 3.5 Technical debt and risks (known)

- **Next.js build**: `experimental.turbo` deprecation warning during build; consider migrating to `turbopack` config per Next.js guidance.
- **Node version**: Local environments may use Node 22+; project targets Node 20 LTS — document or enforce via `.nvmrc` / `engines`.
- **`dbScoped` typing**: Uses Drizzle transaction parameter typing; consumers should treat `tx` as the transaction API only.
- **Static generation**: Home page uses `force-dynamic` to avoid build-time FS issues; revisit when config path strategy is unified for CI/build.

---

## 4. Next steps (recommended order)

### 4.1 Near term

1. **Phase 02 kickoff** — `packages/agent-runtime` contracts and first LangChain/LangGraph flows consuming normalized adapter output.
2. **Coverage ramp** — Meet methodology targets (prioritize `@agenticverdict/core`, `@agenticverdict/database`, business logic in adapters); track vs review thresholds.
3. **Tenant wiring (product)** — Resolve tenant identity on server routes/workers and ensure any `dbScoped` path runs inside `runWithTenantContext`.
4. **Staging validation** — Load/SLA checks against real vendor sandboxes or contract tests; record baselines for AC-2.3.x.

### 4.2 Medium term

5. **`apps/api` + `apps/worker`** — Standalone API and BullMQ worker per target architecture.
6. **Playwright** — Locale redirect + critical journeys.
7. **Shared UI / i18n** — extract shared UI when needed; broader message keys; **additional locales beyond required `ar`/`en` only if product scope explicitly expands** ( **`fr` is not required** ).
8. **Dev environment** — `docker-compose.yml` (Postgres 16; optional Redis) if not already adopted team-wide.

### 4.3 Continuous

9. **Observability** — Structured logging and metrics (Pino/Prometheus) per `CLAUDE.md`.
10. **Security** — Operational follow-through from [`SECURITY.md`](../../specs/00-core/01-connectors/operations/SECURITY.md) verification matrix (secrets management, TLS at edge, audit logging when implemented).

---

## 5. How to keep this file current

- After each meaningful merge, update **§2** (inventory), **§3** (gaps), and **§4** (next steps).
- On version tags, add a line to **§1** or reference the dated entry under `changelog/`.
- Prefer linking to `specs/00-core/*/tasks.md` / `acceptance-criteria.md` rather than duplicating long checklists here.
